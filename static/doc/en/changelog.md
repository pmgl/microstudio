* Guest mode: visitors can now use microStudio without registering an account
* Improved console now supports multi-line input (when creating a function, loop or object requiring multiple lines)

### Update 2019-10-30
* New console window. Previoulsy was using jquery terminal and caused performance issues. The new console is simpler but without issues :-)
* New home page, more informative and presumably more catchy

### Update 2019-10-23
* ```system.inputs``` provides information on the availability of a keyboard, a mouse, touch screen or gamepads on the host system
* implemented ```mouse``` object (specifically useful to track mouse position when no button is pressed and different mouse buttons separately)
* Fixed wrong call context when global function was called from an object member function

### Update 2019-10-22
* microScript update:
  * object member functions now operate primarily in the object scope ; assigning a value to a variable creates a field in the object ; global scope can still be addressed in object member functions by using the ```global``` object such as in ```global.x = 10``` ; this is to be consistent with the upcoming classes and instanciated objects.
```
a = object
  value = 5
  set = function(v)
    value = v
  end
end
```
(calling ```a.set(5)``` will assign 5 to ```a.value```, rather than global variable ```value```)
  * nested scoping, inspired from JavaScript closures, has been removed. Wasn't documented, neither used I believe. If anything breaks in your code due to this, do not hesitate in contacting me. This should allow better performance when microScript will be transpiled to other languages (starting with JavaScript).
* I hope you like the new microStudio icon :-)

* export sprites of public projects as ZIP file

### Update 2019-09-03
* Fonts! You now have access to 46 different bitmap-style fonts for drawing text.
* Import images to your project by drag & drop to the sprite list (size limit: 256x256 pixels)

### Update 2019-07-15
* Fixed performance issue when using map.set() intensively

### Update 2019-07-10
* Deactivated AudioWorklet, because it may ultimately be responsible for Chrome crashes. As a result, there is an increased delay of the audio playback of the engine. The AudioWorklet will be restored as soon as possible.
